# Bulma Test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) Version 12.2.0.

## Why Here?

This project is just a template to learn a little bit more about Bulma components. I was bored one
night and wanted to try something different than Bootstrap.

As you can simply guess, nothing in this page really works, there is no real design or anything.
But that was never the intend anyway. There are just some random components styled minimally to
check them out. Wanted to see if Bulma components looked good and if the integration with Angular
was fine. This entire project has its own repository just because I wanted this somewhere I can
access when, or if, I ever want to use this CSS Framework.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. App will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
